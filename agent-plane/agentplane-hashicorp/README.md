# Tractus-X Knowledge Agent Plane Hashicorp Vault (KA-EDC-AGENT-HASH)

This folder hosts the [Default Agent (Data) Plane with Hashicorp Vault for the Eclipse Dataspace Connector (EDC)](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.dataspaceconnector).

The module sets up/depends on
* an EDC Data Plane with a secret store tailored to the Azure Vault
* supports HttpData and AmazonS3 sources (such as used by AAS submodels)
* supports possibly multiple Http sub-protocols, currently
  * urn:cx:Protocol:w3c:Http#SPARQL for Graph-Based sources by means of the Apache Jena Fuseki engine
  * urn:cx:Protocol:w3c:Http#SKILL for downloading or delegating pre-defined queries
* allows to build up a graph-based federated data catalogue
* includes the JWT-AUTH extension which may shield any endpoint with additional layers of authentication, such as against Oauth2 IDPs

For the configuration options, please see the [Agent Plane Extension](../agent-plane-protocol/README.md#step-2-configuration)

For a sample configuration including Hashicorp Vault, see [this sample properties file](resources/dataplane.properties)

## Building

You could invoke the following command to compile and test the Agent Plane

```console
mvn -s ../../../settings.xml install
```

## Deployment & Usage

### Containerizing 

You could invoke the following command to compile and test the Agent Plane

```console
mvn -s ../../../settings.xml install -Pwith-docker-image
```

Alternatively, after a sucessful [build](#building) the docker image of the Agent Plane is created using

```console
docker build -t tractusx/agentplane-hashicorp:1.10.15 -f src/main/docker/Dockerfile .
```

To run the docker image, you could invoke this command

```console
docker run -p 8082:8082 \
  -v $(pwd)/resources/agent.ttl:/app/agent.ttl \
  -v $(pwd)/resources/dataspace.ttl:/app/dataspace.ttl \
  -v $(pwd)/resources/dataplane.properties:/app/configuration.properties \
  -v $(pwd)/resources/opentelemetry.properties:/app/opentelemetry.properties \
  -v $(pwd)/resources/logging.properties:/app/logging.properties \
  tractusx/agentplane-hashicorp:1.10.15
````

Afterwards, you should be able to access the [local SparQL endpoint](http://localhost:8082/api/agent) via
the browser or by directly invoking a query

```console
curl --request GET 'http://localhost/api/agent?asset=urn:graph:cx:Dataspace&query=SELECT ?senseOfLife WHERE { VALUES (?senseOfLife) { ("42"^^xsd:int) } }' \
--header 'X-Api-Key: foo'
```
