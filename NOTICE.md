## Third-party Content

We provide an [Eclipse Dash License File](DEPENDENCIES) for each release.

You may recreate an up-to-date DEPENDENCIES file by invoking

```shell
./mvnw org.eclipse.dash:license-tool-plugin:license-check -Ddash.summary=DEPENDENCIES
```

We provide Software-Bill-Of-Material (SBOM) documents for each KA-EDC module for each release:
* [EDC Common JWT Auth](common/auth-jwt/auth-jwt-1.9.8-sbom.json)
* [EDC Data Plane Agent Protocols](agent-plane/agent-plane-protocol/agent-plane-protocol-1.9.8-sbom.json)
* [EDC Agent Plane (Hashicorp Vault)](agent-plane/agent-plane-hashicorp/agent-plane-hashicorp-1.9.8-sbom.json)
* [EDC Agent Plane (Azure Vault)](agent-plane/agent-plane-azure-vault/agent-plane-azure-vault-1.9.8-sbom.json)

You may recreate up-to-date SBOMs by invoking

```shell
./mvnw org.cyclonedx:cyclonedx-maven-plugin:makeBom -DoutputName=\${project.artifactId}-\${project.version}-sbom
```
Afterwards, you find the current documents under:
* [EDC Common JWT Auth](common/auth-jwt/target/auth-jwt-1.9.8-sbom.json)
* [EDC Data Plane Agent Protocols](agent-plane/agent-plane-protocol/target/agent-plane-protocol-1.9.8-sbom.json)
* [EDC Agent Plane (Hashicorp Vault)](agent-plane/agent-plane-hashicorp/target/agent-plane-hashicorp-1.9.8-sbom.json)
* [EDC Agent Plane (Azure Vault)](agent-plane/agent-plane-azure-vault/target/agent-plane-azure-vault-1.9.8-sbom.json)
